    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Software Development</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>I began coding in middle school with Arduino in my Robotics Club, where I first began exploring the possibilities of programming through building Lego rovers such as my famed Batmobile (it conquered through sheer force of will, AKA the wheels kept spinning forward until it sensed the next checkpoint). My curiosity led me deeper, from creating Lua scripts and systems for a text-based MUD's combat system to experimenting with HTML for browser-based profiles.
    </p>
    
    <p>In high school, I took my first programming class and used Python to build a text-based adventure, which solidified my desire to pursue software development in college. I attended California Lutheran University, majoring in and receiving my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. Although the curriculum was Java-focused, I taught myself Golang and used it for my capstone project, the CyberDuck Cybersecurity Assistant, my first foray into an automated solution aimed at assisting users in strengthening their cyber posture. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Currently, I am working with Python and C on projects involving networking, encryption, database management, web scraping, and data processing.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">IT & Cybersecurity</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>I started my IT career as a Helpdesk Specialist at my university, where I gained hands-on experience with various technologies and softwares. This role involved assisting students, professors, faculty, and members of a local senior community with technology and cybersecurity. I learned not only how the average user leaves themselves vulnerable to attack, but also of how ill-prepared many people are to reacting to an attack (especially social engineering). </p>
    
    <p>In my junior year, I interned with the LA Rams as an IT Desktop Intern & Helpdesk Specialist during their 2022 Super Bowl-winning season (I even have my own SB LVI ring). I gained experience in securing portable networks, hardening systems for executives, implementing cybersecurity measures like 2FA and VPNs, and auditing the company’s cybersecurity posture according to the NIST CSF Framework.</p>
    
    <p>Afterwards, I returned to my university’s IT Department as a Desktop Specialist, focusing on hardening networks and workstations and finding solutions for using outdated software securely.</p>
